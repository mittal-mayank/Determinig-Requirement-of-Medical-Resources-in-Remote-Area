# Abstract

This project was made for the evaluation of the innovative work for the subject of Modelling and Simulation.

It aims to simulate the medical system in a small remote area to determine the number of beds and ambulances required to provide timely access to health care so that deaths due to such delays can be minimzed.

It draws patterns between the population of the remote area and the required number of beds and ambulances on the basis of various parametres describing the remote area and produces statistical results like average dealy, average queue length and percentage utilization of the system.
